## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakesh-honawad/inventory-management-system.git
cd inventory-management-system
```
### 2. Open the Project

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code (with Java extensions).
Wait for Maven to download all dependencies automatically.

### 3. Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally:

mongosh


Verify the available databases:
```bash
show dbs
```
### 4. Configure the Application

In src/main/resources/application.properties:
```bash
spring.application.name=inventory-management
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/inventorydb
```
### 5. Run the Application

Start the application using:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or run InventoryManagementApplication from your IDE.
Once started, visit: http://localhost:8080

### 6. Test the Endpoints

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman
 or curl.

Sample Endpoints

**Create a Product**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/products
Body (JSON):
{
  "name": "Wireless Mouse",
  "description": "Logitech M170",
  "stockQuantity": 25,
  "lowStockThreshold": 10
}
```

**Get All Products**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

**Get a Product by ID**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}
```

**Update a Product**
```bash
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}
Body (JSON):
{
  "name": "Updated Mouse",
  "description": "Updated Description",
  "stockQuantity": 30,
  "lowStockThreshold": 5
}
```

**Delete a Product**
```bash
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}
```

**Increase Stock**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}/increase?amount=10
```

 **Decrease Stock**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/products/{id}/decrease?amount=5
```

**Fetch Low-Stock Products**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/low-stock
```
### 7. Verify Data in MongoDB

After inserting data through Postman, check the database:
```bash
use inventorydb
show collections
db.products.find().pretty()
```

### 8. Push to GitHub

After making changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```
